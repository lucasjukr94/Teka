OpenTK-WPF
==========
Examples of how to using OpenGL via OpenTK in WPF applications

This solution contains two projects. One project shows the usage of OpenTK in WPF via a WindowsFormsHost and the other by using a Framebuffer object.

The Framebuffer-approach is a "pure"-WPF-approach, but the WinformsHost-approach is faster (32 vs 48fps).

Feel free to improve!
